  "text" : "h3. March 2015\r\n\r\n_Advanced online publication March 2015_\r\n\r\n* Guidelines regarding the use of pharmacogenomic tests in dosing of tacrolimus have been published in Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics by the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium ([CPIC|/contributors/consortia/cpic_profile.jsp]). \r\n* These guidelines are applicable to:\r\n** Patients undergoing kidney, heart, lung, or hematopoietic stem cell transplant.\r\n** Patients undergoing liver transplant where the donor and recipient _CYP3A5_ genotypes are identical.\r\n* Excerpts from the 2015 tacrolimus dosing guidelines:\r\n** \"Blood concentrations of tacrolimus are strongly influenced by _CYP3A5_ genotype, with substantial evidence linking _CYP3A5_ genotype with phenotypic variability...In kidney, heart and lung transplant patients, over 50 studies have found that individuals with the _CYP3A5*1/*1_ or _CYP3A5*1/*3_ genotype have significantly lower dose-adjusted trough concentrations of tacrolimus as compared to those with the _CYP3A5*3/*3_ genotype...\"\r\n** \"Those recipients with an extensive or intermediate metabolizer phenotype will generally require an increased dose of tacrolimus to achieve therapeutic drug concentrations. We recommend a dose 1.5 - 2 times higher than standard dosing, but not to exceed 0.3 mg/kg/day, followed by \\[therapeutic drug monitoring] given the risk of arterial vasoconstriction, hypertension and nephrotoxicity that can occur with supratherapeutic tacrolimus concentrations.\" \r\n\r\n* Download and read:  \r\n** [Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) Guidelines for _CYP3A5_ genotypes and Tacrolimus Dosing|https://github.com/PharmGKB/cpic-guidelines/raw/master/tacrolimus/2015/25801146.pdf] \r\n** [2015 Supplement|https://github.com/PharmGKB/cpic-guidelines/raw/master/tacrolimus/2015/25801146-supplement.pdf]\r\n** [2015 Tacrolimus translation table|https://github.com/PharmGKB/cpic-guidelines/raw/master/tacrolimus/2015/25801146-CYP3A5%20translation%20table.xlsx]\r\n** [CYP3A5 allele frequency table|https://github.com/PharmGKB/cpic-guidelines/raw/master/tacrolimus/2015/25801146-CYP3A5%20allele%20frequency%20table.xlsx]\r\n\r\nh3. Table 1: Dosing recommendations for tacrolimus based on CYP3A5 phenotype:\r\n_Adapted from Tables 1 and 2 of the 2015 guideline manuscript._\r\n\r\n|| Likely phenotype ^a^ || Genotypes || Examples of diplotypes ^b^ || Implications for tacrolimus pharmacologic measures || Therapeutic Recommendations ^c^ || Classification of recommendations ^e^ ||\r\n| Extensive metabolizer (CYP3A5 expresser) | An individual carrying two functional alleles | *1/*1 | Lower dose-adjusted trough concentrations of tacrolimus and decreased chance of achieving target tacrolimus concentrations | Increase starting dose 1.5 to 2 times recommended starting dose ^d^. Total starting dose should not exceed 0.3mg/kg/day. Use therapeutic drug monitoring to guide dose adjustments | Strong |\r\n| Intermediate metabolizer (CYP3A5 expresser) | An individual carrying one functional allele and one non-functional allele | *1/*3, *1/*6, *1/*7| Lower dose-adjusted trough concentrations of tacrolimus and decreased chance of achieving target tacrolimus concentrations | Increase starting dose 1.5 to 2 times recommended starting dose ^d^. Total starting dose should not exceed 0.3mg/kg/day. Use therapeutic drug monitoring to guide dose adjustments | Strong |\r\n| Poor metabolizer (CYP3A5 non-expresser) | An individual carrying two non-functional alleles | *3/*3, *6/*6, *7/*7, *3/*6, *3/*7, *6/*7| Higher (“normal”) dose-adjusted trough concentrations of tacrolimus and increased chance of achieving target tacrolimus concentrations | Initiate therapy with standard recommended dose. Use therapeutic drug monitoring to guide dose adjustments | Strong |\r\n\r\n^a^ Typically with other CYP enzymes, an extensive metabolizer would be classified as a “normal” metabolizer, and therefore, the drug dose would not change based on the patient’s genotype. However, in the case of CYP3A5 and tacrolimus, a CYP3A5 expresser (i.e. CYP3A5 extensive metabolizer or intermediate metabolizer) would require a higher recommended starting dose and the CYP3A5 non-expresser (i.e. poor metabolizer) would require the standard recommended starting dose.\r\n^b^ Additional rare variants such as _CYP3A5*2, *8_, and _*9_ may be found which are of unknown functional significance.
