Variants have been added to the table below that are not in the published 2014 guideline or supplement; specifically, variants other than G551D and F508del._\r\n\r\n| CFTR Genotype | Examples of diplotypes | Implications for ivacaftor effects  | Recommendations for ivacaftor therapy | Classification of recommendation for ivacaftor therapy ^c^|\r\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\r\n| Homozygous or Heterozygous G551D-CFTR, [variant:rs75527207] genotype  AA or AG | G551D/ F508del, G551D/ G551D | Significant improvement in lung function, weight, risk of pulmonary exacerbation, patient reported outcomes, and reduction in sweat chloride concentrations through enhanced CFTR channel activity (increase probability of open channel). | Use ivacaftor according to the product label (e.g., 150 mg every 12 hours for patients age 6 and older without other diseases; modify dose in patients with hepatic impairment) | Strong | \r\n| Homozygous for F508del-CFTR, [variant:rs113993960] or [variant:rs199826652] genotype del/del | F508del/F508del| No significant reduction in sweat chloride concentrations; no changes in other clinical measurements including spirometric measurements, pulmonary exacerbations, or body weight ^b^. Unlikely to respond to treatment. | Ivacaftor is not recommended ^a^ | Moderate ^b^ | \r\n|Homozygous or heterozygous for one of the following _CFTR_ variants that affect gating: G1244E ([variant:rs267606723] genotype AA or AG), G1349D ([variant:rs193922525] genotype AA or AG), G178R ([variant:rs80282562] genotype AA or AG), G551S ([variant:rs121909013] genotype AA or AG), S1251N ([variant:rs74503330] genotype AA or AG), S1255P ([variant:rs121909041] genotype CC or CT), S549N ([variant:rs121908755] genotype AA or AG), S549R ([variant:rs121909005] genotype GG or GT, [variant:rs121908757] genotype CC or CA) ^d^  | F508del/S549N | Significantly enhanced channel open probability _in vitro_ [PMID: 22293084]. _In vitro_ assays with CFBEo- cells expressing S549N-CFTR showed ivacaftor potentiated chloride channel function [PMID: 23027855], and a case study showed improved lung function after ivacaftor treatment in a 12-year-old girl with CF with a copy of the S549N variant [PMID: 24081349]. | Use ivacaftor according to the product label (e.g., 150 mg every 12 hours for patients age 6 and older without other diseases; modify dose in patients with hepatic impairment) | Moderate |\r\n\r\n^a^ These recommendations are based on treatment of CF patients with ivacaftor alone and current evidence. Clinical trials are currently underway to investigate ivacaftor alone or in combination with other drugs to treat CF patients with CFTR variants other than G551D, therefore there is potential that ivacaftor may be effective in these patients. See the 2014 guidelines for further details.\r\n\r\n^b^ The recommendation for patients with the F508del/F508del genotype is based on ivacaftor mechanism of action and clinical observational data. The clinical study however was a safety study and was not powered to detect a difference in efficacy [PMID: 22383668].\r\n\r\n^c^ Rating scheme described in the 2014 supplement.\r\n\r\n^d^ Variants listed in this table include those added to the amended [drug label for ivacaftor](/label/PA166104890) which was approved by the FDA on February 21, 2014. The modifications to this table were made after the acceptance of publication of the 2014 CPIC Ivacaftor-CFTR guideline [PMID: 24598717] and are not reflected in the PDFs of the CPIC guideline main manuscript or supplement. \r\n\r\n## Figure 1: Treatment algorithm for clinical use of Ivacaftor for cystic fibrosis patients based on _CFTR_ genotype.\r\n\r\n_Adapted from Figure 1 of the 2014 guideline manuscript (April 2014 Update on PharmGKB).  Variants have been added to this figure that are not in the published 2014 guideline or supplement; specifically, variants other than G551D and F508del._\r\n\r\n![Adapted diagram from Figure 1](Slide1.png)\r\n\r\n^e^ Ivacaftor is not recommended for CF patients with other CFTR variants or in patients homozygous for the F508del variant (see 2014 guideline for further details, supporting evidence and disclaimers). Future clinical trials for other CFTR variants are ongoing.",
