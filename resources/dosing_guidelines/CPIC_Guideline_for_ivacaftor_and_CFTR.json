Clinical trials are currently underway to investigate ivacaftor alone or in combination with other drugs to treat CF patients with CFTR variants other than G551D, therefore there is potential that ivacaftor may be effective in these patients. See the 2014 guidelines for further details.<br/><sup>b</sup> The recommendation for patients with the F508del/F508del genotype is based on ivacaftor mechanism of action and clinical observational data. The clinical study however was a safety study and was not powered to detect a difference in efficacy [Article:<a href=\"/pmid/22383668\">22383668</a>].<br/><sup>c</sup> Rating scheme described in the 2014 supplement.<br/><sup>d</sup> Variants listed in this table include those added to the amended <a href=\"/label/PA166104890\">drug label for ivacaftor</a> which was approved by the FDA on February 21, 2014.
