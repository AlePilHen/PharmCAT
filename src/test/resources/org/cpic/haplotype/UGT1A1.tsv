Note	Bases reported on the positive chromosomal strand from dbSNP (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/). Alleles are derived from the UDP-Glucoronosyltransferase (UGT) Alleles Nomenclature page (http://www.pharmacogenomics.pha.ulaval.ca/cms/site/pharmacogenomics/ugt_alleles). See https://www.pharmgkb.org/gene/PA420 for updates on UGT1A1 gene alleles and nomenclature.

Note	An important caveat for all genotyping tests is that the decision to assign an allele a “wild-type” status is based upon a genotyping test that interrogates only the most common and already- proven sites of functional variation. In human DNA, it is always possible that a new, previously undiscovered (and therefore un-interrogated) site of variation may confer loss-of-function in an individual, and thus lead to the rare possibility of a non-functional allele being erroneously called as “wild-type”.	
Note	UGT1A1*60 is in incomplete linkage disequilibrium with *28 and to date, there are no data to suggest that *60 by itself results in decreased UGT1A1 function.
