Name	Match:Gene	Match:Haplotype	Missing:Haplotype	Missing:Variant	Match:Diplotype	Match: Guideline	Notes	Type	Message	Version
CYP2C19 *17 check for *4B	CYP2C19	*17 		rs28399504				ambiguity	Warning!: haplotype matches *17 (increased function), however due to the lack of coverage for *4B we can't also rule out this position (no function).	1
CYP2C19 *17 missing	CYP219		*17				display in case CYP2C19*17 information  is missing from Vcf file	gene-specific warnings	CYP2C19*17, a common variant found in some populations, is defined by a variant (rs12248560) in the CYP2C19 promoter region. Due to missing information in the VCF file, this allele cannot be detected or ruled out, and further testing is warranted.	1
TPMT *1/*3A warning	TPMT				*1/*3A		footnote wherever this diplotype appears, e.g. Table 1 in report and Gene section	ambiguity	We have detected *1/*3A. Most likely the diplotype is *1/*3A but *3B/*3C can't be ruled out.	1
TPMT reverse complement footnote	TPMT							footnote	All calls for this gene in this report refers to the positive chromosomal strand, so are complemented from gene bases.	1
VKORC1	VKORC1							footnote	This haplotype only uses a single position, and may not be applicable to all populations.	1
UGT1A1 repeat warning	UGT1A1							footnote	This genes relies on a multiple repeat to differentiate between several star allelles. Some technologies may struggle to make this call accurately.	1
UGT1A1 trans rule breaker *28 and *80	UGT1A1				*28/*80			ambiguity	We have detected matches to *28 and *80. These are usually seen in trans suggesting subject is *1/*28+80, however we cannot rule out *28/*80.	1
CYP3A5 Exome warning	CYP3A5							ambiguity	There was one or more functional variants in an intron; intronic variants are important for CYP3A5 so you want to do further testing.	1
CYP3A5 *3 missing	CYP3A5						display in case CYP3A5*3 information  is missing from Vcf file	gene-specific warnings	CYP3A5*3, a common variant found in some populations, is defined by a splicing defect caused by an intronic variant (rs776746). Due to missing information in the VCF file, this allele cannot be detected or ruled out, and further testing is warranted.	1
CYP3A5 reverse complement footnote	CYP3A5							footnote	The CYP3A5 gene is on the reverse DNA strand relative to chromosomal numbering. All bases are reported on the positive chromosomal strand. Therefore, bases reported for CYP3A5 will be complimentary to the bases in the gene.	1
Warfarin warning	VKORC1					warfarin	The only Guideline level match so far - however just gene may be appropiate	footnote	Guideline only considers a single snp in VKORC1, which is found in the highest frequency in Caucasians and extremely low frequency in those of African descent. While other functional variants in VKORC1 have been observed in much higher frequency in those of African descent, there are currently no CPIC recommendations for how to use these other variants in warfarin dosing.	1
VKORC1 reverse complement footnote	VKORC1							footnote	This haplotype only uses a single position, and may not be applicable to all populations.	1
warfarin recommendation text						warfarin	display under instead of table under CYP2C19 diplotype and VKROC1 genotype	note	Alternate name for rs9923231 is -1639. VKORC1 is on the reverse DNA strand relative to chromosomal numbering.  PharmCAT reports bases on the positive chromosomal strand. Estimate the anticipated stable dose of warfarin using the algorithms available on http://www.warfarindosing.org, the IWPC Pharmacogenetic Dosing Algorithm or the FDA-approved drug label. Link to full guideline: https://www.pharmgkb.org/guideline/PA166104949.	1
warfarin-CYP2C9 display						warfarin	Don't create summary statement for CYP2C9 diplotype regarding allele function and phenotype.	exception		1
DYPD *1/*2B ambiguity	DYPD				*1/*2B		when this diplotype has the highest score, we want to report CPIC recommendation for *2A/*5 and say the person can be either diplotype with the same probability with unphased data	ambiguity	*2B contains the variants for *2A and *5, so without phasing, *1/*2B and *2A/*5 can't be distinguished.  However, CPIC provides NO recommendation for *2B, though it lists the allele in supplemental table S1.  PharmCAT will return BOTH possible diplotypes with the SAME recommendation.	1
DPYD reverse complement footnote	DYPD							footnote	The DPYD gene is on the reverse DNA strand relative to chromosomal numbering. All bases are reported on the positive chromosomal strand. Therefore, bases reported for DPYD will be complimentary to the bases in the gene.	1
CYP2C19 *1/*2 ambiguity	CYP2C19				*1/*2			ambiguity	Without phasing, we cannot determine the difference between a *1/*2 call and a *2/*35 call when both snps are present but no other snps are present.  *1/*2 is an IM and *2/*35 is a PM (no functional protein), so this will result in DIFFERENT recommendations.	1
IFNL3 reverse complement footnote	IFNL3							footnote	The IFNL3 gene is on the reverse DNA strand relative to chromosomal numbering. All bases are reported on the positive chromosomal strand. Therefore, bases reported for IFNL3 will be complimentary to the bases in the gene.	1
amitriptyline two gene display 						amitriptyline	add * after classification of recommendation input	footnote		1
two gene guidelines						amitriptyline, clomipramine, doxepin, imipramine, trimipramine	in case one gene missing, use rows with unknown/unknown for missing gene and diplotype value for avaibale information	data display	CYP3A5*3, a common variant found in some populations, is defined by a splicing defect caused by an intronic variant (rs776746). Due to missing information in the VCF file, this allele cannot be detected or ruled out, and further testing is warranted.	1
alternate diplotype (PharmCAT)							display in case alternate diplotype results in different recommendation	data display		1
alternate CYP2D6 diplotypes 						amitriptyline, clomipramine, doxepin, imipramine, trimipramine, nortriptyline, desipramine, codeine, ondansetron, paroxetine, fluvoxamine, tropisetron	display recommendation for any diplotype received from Astrolabe	data display		1
UGT1A1 no call						atazanvir		data display	UGT1A1: No diplotype call was achievable with the provided variant information (see Allele call section)	1
UGT1A1 no call_look up rs887829	UGT1A1					atazanvir	display rs887829 diplotype , message and relavant recommendation (currently stored under *80)	data display	Note: In addition to recommendations based on UGT1A1 star (*) nomenclature diplotype, CPIC provides prescribing information based on rs887829 genotype.	1
CYP2C19*35 recommendation		*35				es/citalopram, clopidogrel, sertraline		data display	CPIC does not provide recommendations for this diplotype. CPIC guidelines reflect the alleles/genotypes known and considered by the guideline authors for inclusion by the time of publication. CPIC guidelines are periodically updated.	1
CFTR no variants found	CFTR					ivacafor	in case no variants included in the definition table are detected, display no table in recommendation section	data display	CFTR: No CPIC variants are found. CPIC does not provide recommendations for this diplotype. CPIC guidelines reflect the alleles/genotypes known and considered by the guideline authors for inclusion by the time of publication. CPIC guidelines are periodically updated. Link to full guideline: https://www.pharmgkb.org/guideline/PA166114461	1
Phenytoin_HLA-B warning						phenytoin	add under the diplotype display in the recommendation section (II)	note	The CPIC dosing recommendation is ONLY valid for non-carriers of the HLA-B*15:02 high-risk allele. PharmCAT does not interpret HLA carrier status. Determining HLA-B alleles is warranted for phenytoin dosing. Phenytoin is contraindicated in individuals with the HLA-B*15:02 variant allele ("HLA-B*15:02-positive") due to significantly increased risk of phenytoin-induced cutaneous adverse reactions of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). In HLA-B*15:02 carriers Carbamazepine should not be used as an alternative. Alternative medications such as oxcarbazepine, eslicarbazepine acetate, and lamotrigine have some evidence linking SJS/TEN with the HLA-B*15:02 allele, and thus caution should be used in choosing alternatives to phenytoin.	1
SLCO1B1 no call						simvastatin		data display	SLCO1B1: No diplotype call was achievable with the provided variant information (see Allele call section)	1
SLCO1B1 diplotype-rs4149056	SLCO1B1					simvastatin	look up rs4149056 genoype and provide recommendations based on genotype (currently stored under *5)	data display	SLCO1B1 variation can be assigned a star nomenclature representing various SNPs alone or in combination. The C allele at rs4149056 is contained within SLCO1B1*5 (rs4149056 alone) as well as the *15 and *17 haplotypes and is associated with lower plasma clearance of simvastatin. The magnitude of this effect is similar for *5, *15, and *17 haplotypes. 	1
simvastatin table footnote						simvastatin		footnote	In all cases, the potential for drug-drug interaction should be evaluated prior to initiating a prescription. FDA recommends against 80mg of simvastatin (unless already tolerated 12 months).	1
tacrolismus table footnote						tacrolismus		footnote	This recommendation includes the use of tacrolimus in kidney, heart, lung and hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients, and liver transplant patients where the donor and recipient genotypes are identical.	1
