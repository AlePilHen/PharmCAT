Note	See Human Cytochrome P450 Allele Nomenclature Committee website (http://www.cypalleles.ki.se) for comprehensive haplotype definitions of CYP3A5 variant alleles and updated allele information.	
Note	Cytochrome database references nucleotide changes based on NCBI Reference Sequence NG_000004.3 as detailed at http://www.cypalleles.ki.se/cyp3a5.htm.	
Note	For *9 the existence of the rs776746 (*3) polymorphism on the same allele cannot be excluded.	
Note	Regarding functional status: an important caveat for all genotyping tests is that the decision to assign an allele a “wild- type” status is based upon a genotyping test that interrogates only the most common and already-proven sites of functional variation. In human DNA, it is always possible that a new, previously undiscovered (and therefore un-interrogated) site of variation may confer loss-of- function in an individual, and thus lead to the rare possibility of a non-functional allele being erroneously called as “wild-type”	
Note	Allele frequencies: Average allele frequencies are based on the actual number of subjects with each allele reported
Note	in multiple studies and then grouped according to major race/ethnic groups for studies as defined in http://www.pharmgkb.org/download.action?filename=CYP3A5_Literature_Table.xlsx (details and references).
