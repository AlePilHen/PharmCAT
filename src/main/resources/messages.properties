combo-naming_name=Partial and combination calls-naming
combo-naming_message=Partial and combination allele calls are based on the variants identified in the VCF file. Matches to \
  different star allele definitions or star allele with additional position combinations are connected by a '+', which \
  represents combinations in a single gene copy per allele and does NOT indicate gene duplications.

combo-unphased_name=Partial and combination calls-unphased output
combo-unphased_message=In the case of unphased data, the Named Allele Matcher provides some possible partial or \
  combination allele calls but not all permutations.

cyp2d6-general_name=CYP2D6 -research mode - general
cyp2d6-general_message=The "CYP2D6 research mode" option is included in PharmCAT to allow calling CYP2D6 from SNPs and small \
  indels alone based on the CPIC CYP2D6 allele definition file. This only allows to determine CYP2D6 diplotypes with \
  CYP2D6 star-alleles that do not define or include structural variation, gene deletion, or gene \
  duplication/multiplication. Therefore, PharmCAT in the general setting does not determine CYP2D6 diplotypes from vcf \
  files due to the large influence of structural variation and copy number variation (CNVs) on the predicted CYP2D6 \
  phenotype, which is beyond the scope of what can be called from SNPs in a VCF file.  The feature should be used with \
  the understanding that the CYP2D6 ultrarapid metabolizer phenotype cannot be determined, and the other metabolizer \
  phenotypes might be impacted due to the lack of knowledge about the whole gene deletion or hybrid alleles with CYP2D7.

cyp2d6-mode_name=CYP2D6 -research mode - note
cyp2d6-mode_message=CYP2D6 is highly polymorphic and a number of variants are included in multiple allele definition \
  (e.g., 100C>T). The most specific CYP2D6 genotype can be determined if all positions included in the CYP2D6 allele \
  definition file are provided in the input VCF. An increased number of missing positions will result in an output of \
  several likely genotypes based on the functionality of the Named Allele Matcher.
