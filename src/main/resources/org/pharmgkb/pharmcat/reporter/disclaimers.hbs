  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>PharmCAT uses gene allele definitions included in the CPIC database, with exceptions as noted
        in <a href="https://pharmcat.org/methods/gene-definition-exceptions/"
            rel="nofollow">Gene Definition Exceptions document</a>. For allele
        definitions and the positions used in PharmCAT, see
        the <a href="https://github.com/PharmGKB/PharmCAT/releases">gene definition tables</a>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>PharmCAT results are dependent on the supplied vcf calls for the queried positions (for technical information about
        PharmCAT input formatting and requirements, please go to
        <a href="https://pharmcat.org/" rel="nofollow">pharmcat.org</a>). PharmCAT does not assume any reference calls for positions missing from the
        submitted vcf file; all missing queried positions are not considered in the allele determination process. See
        the <a href="https://github.com/PharmGKB/PharmCAT/releases">gene definition tables</a> for more information about what positions
        are queried in the vcf file. Missing positions might alter the assigned genotype, subsequent phenotype prediction and
        CPIC recommendation. If the supplied vcf file is missing positions, those positions will be noted in Section 3:
        Allele Calls for each gene of this report. For the most reliable allele determination, reference calls as well as
        variant calls in the vcf file for every queried position must be provided by the user.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>For cytochrome P450 genes, TPMT, NUDT15, UGT1A1, and SLCO1B1, the *1 allele is defined by the absence of variation
        specified in the gene definition tables. This allele cannot be identified by variants; rather, *1 is assigned by
        default when no variation for the queried positions is reported in the submitted vcf file. The same is true for all
        other genes with multiple variant positions in the definition table (CACNA1S, CFTR, DPYD, RYR1): the reference
        sequence is the default result when variants are not reported in the vcf file. It is always possible un-interrogated
        variation can occur which could potentially affect allele function, but because it is undetected, the assignment
        would be defaulted to a *1 (or reference) allele and normal function.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>For all genes, variation reported in the vcf file but NOT included in the gene definition table will not be
        considered during allele assignment. There is a possibility that any such variation results in a reduced or no
        activity allele which could lead to inaccurate phenotype and CPIC recommendation, similar to the situation in point
        3, above.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Nucleotide base calls are displayed on the positive chromosomal strand regardless of the gene strand; further
        information is provided under Gene-specific warnings in Section 3: Allele Calls.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>PharmCAT matches variants to genotypes assuming unphased data (unless phased data is provided in the vcf file and
        noted as such, see
        <a href="https://pharmcat.org/" rel="nofollow">pharmcat.org</a> for details). The assumption is that defined alleles exist in trans
        configuration, i.e. on opposite chromosomes, with exceptions noted in Section 3: Allele Calls under
        "Gene-specific warnings." However, in cases where an allele is defined by a combination of two or more variants,
        where each variant alone also defines an allele, the match is based on the longer allele. For example, TPMT*3B is
        defined by one SNP, *3C is defined by another SNP, and *3A is defined by the combination of those two SNPs. In the
        case of unphased data that is heterozygous for both SNPs, the *1/*3A genotype is returned though the possibility of
        *3B/*3C cannot be ruled out.</p>
      <p>Below cases are summarized for which two calls with different scores are possible when provided unphased data and
        heterozygous calls for the variants that define the two alleles. The genotype with the higher score (longer allele)
        will be used to determine allele functionality, phenotype, and recommendation but the genotype with the lower score
        cannot be ruled out.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>A version of the following quoted disclaimer is part of each CPIC guideline and applies to the CPIC recommendations
      as used in PharmCAT. For the full description of potential benefits and risks, additional considerations (general and
      specific to gene-drug pairs), limitations, information about respective gene nomenclature systems, potential
      drug-drug interactions and clinical factors to consider, please see individual CPIC guidelines
      (<a href="https://cpicpgx.org" rel="nofollow">cpicpgx.org</a>).
      <ol>
        <li>"CPIC guidelines reflect expert consensus based on clinical evidence and peer-reviewed literature available at
          the time they are written and are intended only to assist clinicians in decision making and to identify questions
          for further research. New evidence may have emerged since the time a guideline was submitted for publication.
          Guidelines are limited in scope and are not applicable to interventions or diseases not specifically identified.
          Guidelines do not account for all individual variations among patients and cannot be considered inclusive of all
          proper methods of care or exclusive of other treatments. It remains the responsibility of the health-care
          provider to determine the best course of treatment for a patient. Adherence to any guidelines is voluntary, with
          the ultimate determination regarding its application to be made solely by the clinician and the patient. CPIC
          assumes no responsibility for any injury to persons or damage to persons or property arising out of or related to
          any use of CPIC's guidelines, or for any errors or omissions." (PMID:

        <li>"Caveats: appropriate use and/or potential misuse of genetic tests. The application of genotype-based dosing is
          most appropriate when initiating therapy with a tricyclic. Obtaining a pharmacogenetic test after months of drug
          therapy may be less helpful in some instances, as the drug dose may have already been adjusted based on plasma
          concentrations, response, or side effects. Similar to all diagnostic tests, genetic tests are one of several
          pieces of clinical information that should be considered before initiating drug therapy." (PMID:

      of publication, however they may be updated online at
      <a href="https://cpicpgx.org" rel="nofollow">cpicpgx.org</a> and in the CPIC database in between publications. Additional alleles and/or more
      extensive allele definitions might exist by the representative gene nomenclatures for various genes.</li>
