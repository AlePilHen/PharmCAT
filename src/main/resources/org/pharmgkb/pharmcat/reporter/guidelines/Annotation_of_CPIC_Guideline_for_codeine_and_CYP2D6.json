There is substantial evidence for decreased efficacy of tramadol in poor metabolizers and a single case report of toxicity in an ultrarapid metabolizer with renal impairment following tramadol post-surgery. Use of other analgesics in CYP2D6 poor and ultrarapid metabolizers may therefore be preferable. Some other opioid analgesics are metabolized by CYP2D6, such as hydrocodone and oxycodone. To avoid treatment complications, opioids that are not metabolized by CYP2D6, including morphine, oxymorphone, buprenorphine, fentanyl, methadone and hydromorphone, along with non-opioid analgesics, may be considered as alternatives for use in CYP2D6 poor and ultrarapid metabolizers._",
