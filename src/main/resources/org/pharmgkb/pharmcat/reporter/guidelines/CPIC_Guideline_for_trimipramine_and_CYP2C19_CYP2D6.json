Greater conversion of tertiary amines to secondary amines may affect response or side effects.| Avoid tertiary amine use due to potential for sub-optimal response. Consider alternative drug not metabolized by CYP2C19.  TCAs without major CYP2C19 metabolism include the secondary amines nortriptyline and desipramine. // If a tertiary amine is warranted, utilize therapeutic drug monitoring to guide dose adjustments.^e^| Optional |\r\n| CYP2C19 Rapid metabolizer (~2-30% of patients)^d^ | An individual carrying one normal and one increased function allele |*1/*17| Increased metabolism of tertiary amines compared to normal metabolizers.

See other considerations in the guideline for dosing recommendations for conditions where lower initial doses are used, such as neuropathic pain.\r\n\r\n^c^ The rating scheme for the recommendation of classification is described in the Supplement. It may be reasonable to apply amitriptyline recommendation to other TCAs also metabolized by CYP2C19 including clomipramine, doxepin, imipramine, and trimipramine. There are fewer clinical and pharmacokinetic data supporting dose adjustments for these drugs when compared to amitriptyline or nortriptyline (Supplemental Tables S8-S16). \r\n\r\n^d^ CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 metabolizer status frequencies are based on average multi-ethnic frequencies. See the CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 Frequency Tables for population-specific allele and phenotype frequencies.\r\n\r\n^e^ Titrate dose to observed clinical response with symptom improvement and minimal (if any) side effects. \r\n\r\n^f^ Patients may receive an initial low dose of a tricyclic, which is then increased over several days to the recommended steady-state dose. The starting dose in this guideline refers to the recommended steady-state dose.\r\n\r\n^g^ The predicted metabolizer phenotype for the*2/*17 genotype is a provisional classification. The currently available evidence indicates that the CYP2C19*17 increased function allele is unable to completely compensate for the CYP2C19*2 no function allele.\r\n\r\n## May 2013\r\n\r\nGuidelines regarding the use of pharmacogenomic tests in dosing for tricyclic antidepressants have been published in Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics by the [Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC)](https://cpicpgx.org).\r\n\r\n__Download:__ [article]( https://github.com/PharmGKB/cpic-guidelines/raw/master/TCA/2013/23486447.pdf) and [supplement]( https://github.com/PharmGKB/cpic-guidelines/raw/master/TCA/2013/23486447-supplement.pdf)\r\n\r\n#### Excerpt from the dosing guidelines:\r\n\r\n[Amitriptyline](http://www.pharmgkb.org/drug/PA448385) and nortriptyline are used as model drugs for this guideline because the majority of pharmacogenomic studies have focused on these two drugs. Because the tricyclics have comparable pharmacokinetic properties, it may be reasonable to apply this [guideline](https://github.com/PharmGKB/cpic-guidelines/raw/master/TCA/2013/23486447.pdf) to other tricyclics including clomipramine ([Supplementary Table S18](https://github.com/PharmGKB/cpic-guidelines/raw/master/TCA/2013/23486447-supplement.pdf)), with the acknowledgement that there are fewer data supporting dose adjustments for these drugs than for amitriptyline or nortriptyline.\r\n\r\n\r\nSee [amitriptyline](http://www.pharmgkb.org/drug/PA448385) for excerpts and tables that summarize _CYP2D6_-based and _CYP2C19_-based dosing recommendations for amitriptyline when higher initial starting doses are warranted ([article](https://github.com/PharmGKB/cpic-guidelines/raw/master/TCA/2013/23486447.pdf)).",
