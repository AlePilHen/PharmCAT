They should not be used, except in extraordinary circumstances where the benefits outweigh the risks. In general, alternative anesthetics are widely available and effective in patients with MHS.</p>\n<p>A list of unsafe halogenated volatile anesthetics or depolarizing muscle relaxants and alternative anesthetics can be found at http://www.mhaus.org/healthcare-professionals/be-prepared/safe-and-unsafe-anesthetics. Individuals who have biallelic (homozygous or compound heterozygous) pathogenic variants in RYR1 generally will have autosomal recessive myopathies and should be managed according to the standard of care for those disorders. Although some may, indeed, have susceptibility to anesthetic agents, the recommendations described here cannot adequately address such patients, and they should be managed by a physician who is knowledgeable regarding those disorders.</p>\n"
