# Gene Definition Exceptions

The genotype determination is based on [CPIC gene definition
tables](https://www.pharmgkb.org/page/pgxGeneRef), with
the following modifications:
    
## SLCO1B1

CPIC provides recommendations based on the rs4149056 genotype or the SLCO1B1 star allele genotype as reporting options
in Table 1 of the [SLCO1B1/simvastatin guideline \[PMID: 24918167\]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24918167/). While
PharmCAT attempts to determine the star allele genotype for SLCO1B1, in case no call can be determined it provides the
CPIC recommendation based on the rs4149056 variant genotype.
